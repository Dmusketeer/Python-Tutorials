# Display the following menu to the user: 
# If they enter a 1, it should run a subprogram that will 
# generate two random numbers between 5 and 20, and 
# ask the user to add them together. Work out the correct 
# answer and return both the user’s answer and the 
# correct answer. 
# If they entered 2 as their selection on the menu, it 
# should run a subprogram that will generate one number 
# between 25 and 50 and another number between 1 and 
# 25 and ask them to work out num1 minus num2. This 
# way they will not have to worry about negative answers. 
# Return both the user’s answer and the correct answer. 
# Create another subprogram that will check if the user’s 
# answer matches the actual answer. If it does, display 
# “Correct”, otherwise display a message that will say 
# “Incorrect, the answer is” and display the real answer. 
# If they do not select a relevant option on the first menu 
# you should display a suitable message.
