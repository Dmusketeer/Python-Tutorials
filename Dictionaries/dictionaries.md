# Python Dictionary type

- A Python dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is associated with a value.

- A **value** in the key-value pair can be a number, a string, a list, a tuple, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use a **value** of any valid type in Python as the value in the key-value pair.

- A key in the key-value pair must be immutable.
- Python uses the curly braces {} to define a dictionary. Inside the curly braces, you can place zero, one, or many key-value pairs.

```py
emp_dict={}
```

- To find the type of a dictionary, you use the type() function
```py
    print(type(empty_dict))
    # Ouptut:
    <class 'dict'>
```
