## Syntax

- A Python statement ends with a newline character.
- Python uses spaces and identation to organize its code structure.
- Identifiers are names that identify variables, functions, modules, classes, etc. in Python.
- Comments describe why the code works. They are ingored by the Python interpreter.
- Use the single quote, double-quotes, tripple-quotes, or tripple double-quotes to denote

## Variables

- A variable is a label that you can assign a value to it. The value of a variable can change throughout the program.
- Use the variable_name = value to create a variable.
- The variable names should be as concise and descriptive as possible. Also, they should adhere to Python variable naming rules.

**NOTE :** Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the - underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

## Python String

<ul>
<li>In Python, a string is a series of characters. Also, Python strings are immutable.</li>
<li>Use quotes, either single-quotes or double-quotes to create string literals.</li>
<li>Use the backslash character \ to escape quotes in strings</li>
<li>
Use raw strings r'...' to escape the backslash character.</li>
<li>Use f-strings to insert substitute variables in literal strings.</li>
<li>
Place literal strings next to each other to concatenate them. And use the + operator to concatenate string variables.</li>
<li>Use the len() function to get the size of a string.</li>
<li>
Use the str[n] to access the character at the position n of the string str.</li>
<li>
Use slicing to extract a substring from a string.</li>
</ul>

<em>NOTE :</em> Escape characters used in Python
