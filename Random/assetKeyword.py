# The assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the 
# program will raise an AssertionError than can be written by ourselves.


# Syntax 
# assert {condition}, {message}


name = "Dheeraj"
#if condition returns False, AssertionError is raised:
assert name == "dheeraj", "x should be 'Dheeraj'"
