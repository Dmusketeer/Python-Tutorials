# Problem Statement (Word is Key)
# One programming language has the following keywords that cannot be used as identifiers:

# break, case, continue, default, defer, else, for, func, goto, if, map, range, return, struct, type, var

# Write a program to find if the given word is a keyword or not

# Test cases
# Case 1
# Input – defer
# Expected Output – defer is a keyword
# Case 2
# Input – While
# Expected Output – while is not a keyword


# Solution:

keyword = {"break", "case", "continue", "default", "defer", "else", "for", 
"func", "goto", "if", "map", "range", "return", "struct", "type", "var"}

input_var = input()
if input_var in keyword:
    print(input_var+ " is a keyword")
else:
    print(input_var+ " is a not keyword")
