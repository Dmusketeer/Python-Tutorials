# -:-Python OOPs Concepts -:-     


- In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects in programming. 
- It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.
- The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. 

### <b>Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) </b>
- Class
- Objects
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance

## <b>Class</b> 
- A class is a collection of objects.
- A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. 
- It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. 

<b> Some points on Python class: </b> <br/> 
- Classes are created by keyword class.
- Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
- Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute


Class Definition Syntax:

        class ClassName:
        # Statement-1
        .
        .
        .
        # Statement-N


Ex: <br/>

    class Dog:
        pass
